    <h1>About the Creator</h1>
    <p>Reid Allen is a second year student at Algonquin College in the Graphic Design program. For his final assignment in his web design class he's making a 3 page website. After thinking about it for a while he realized that the music he likes to listen to is on multiple streaming medias and he wanted to change that. This is his solution, Music Hub, a place where all your favourite artist and songs are in one spot.</p>
