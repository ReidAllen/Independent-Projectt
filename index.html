    <p>Reid Allen is a second year student at Algonquin College in the Graphic Design program. For his final assignment in his web design class he's making a 3 page website.

This is his solution, Music Hub, a place where all your favourite artist and songs are in one spot. Though he just started to code last semester, with the help from his peers and prof he is excited to present to you his website, Hopefully it helps you to find all your favourtie music.</p>
